# work-day-scheduler

This application features a set of rows that are linked to the common work day (9AM-5PM). Each row contains an input box that a user can type in (events, reminders, etc) and save (using a save button respective to that row) that text to local storage. Upon refresh, the page will display the previously saved/input events within those text boxes. 

The webpage was put together using HTML, JS, and CSS styling.
