# work-day-scheduler

This application features a set of rows that are linked to the common work day (9AM-5PM). Each row contains an input box that a user can type in (events, reminders, etc) and save (using a save button respective to that row) that text to local storage. Upon refresh, the page will display the previously saved/input events within those text boxes. 

The webpage was put together using HTML, JS, and CSS styling. 

An image of the app is available within the content of this workspace on github.
